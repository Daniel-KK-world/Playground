#MY PYTHON PLAYGROUND

##
well if I hit a block on what project to do next or it's kind of a secret I just like to play around 
with anything at all mostly random. 
I am stuck with tkinter for the time being. 
Also most of the projects here are not worthy of having a dedicated repo and read me.... 
ideas are welcome tho on what to build. 
Repo worthy or not lol.
